C# Projects

During the C# course, I worked on several different projects and assignments to get an understanding on the core fundamentals and experience working with it's logic.

Projects:

Card Insurance

Car Insurance

The Car Insurance app was a way to gain a broad understanding on conditional logic within C# to create an app that will compare certain scenarios with one another and output a complete valued quote for the user depending on their individual situation. I added an Admin Panel for past quotes that have occured as well.
