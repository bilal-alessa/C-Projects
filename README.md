<h2>C# Projects</h2>

During the C# course, I worked on several different projects and assignments to get an understanding on the core fundamentals and experience working with its logic.

<h3>Projects:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Card Insurance</li>
  <li>TwentyOne Game</li>
</ul>
<h3>Car Insurance</h3>

The Car Insurance app was a way to gain a broad understanding on conditional logic within C# to create an app that will compare certain scenarios with one another and output a complete valued quote for the user depending on their individual situation. I added an Admin Panel for past quotes that have occurred as well.

<h3>TwentyOne Game</h3>

The largest app i was tasked to create along with one of the instructors was a full TwentyOne Console Game. This included many methods and classes in correspondent with one another to fully develop a working casino game and logic behind the deal, cards, and a full deck.
